If local files path directory is provided to the application, it tries to find the
required files in provided local directory and if it cannot find the files, the
application stops.

However, if the local files path directory is NOT provided, then by default, the
application looks for required files in this directory (files_container) and if it does
not find those files here, then application stops.
